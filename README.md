# vscode-spectre-assist

## Features

Syntax Highlighting for spectre `*.in` files (specifically calculation statements in input files)

Makes the code just that _**little**_ bit easier on the eyes.

## Requirements

none

## Extension Setup

Move this extension (root directory) to `%USERPROFILE%\.vscode\extensions`

Just open a `*.in` file! if you don't see any syntax highlighting on what you think is a valid file, open the command palette (F1) and try "Change Language Mode".

Type in "spectre" to filter the languages and select `spectre-in` as your language of choice.

Happy coding!

## Feature requests

Just open an issue! make sure to provide details, screenshots, anything that'll get your idea across! If it sounds concrete and I have time, I'll implement it!
