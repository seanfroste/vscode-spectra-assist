# vscode-spectre-assist

## Features

Syntax Highlighting for spectre `*.in` files (specifically calculation statements in input files)

Makes the code just that _**little**_ bit easier on the eyes.

## Requirements

## Extension Setup

### From VSIX

1. Grab the VSIX package from the [Releases](https://github.com/seanfroste/vscode-spectre-assist/releases) page
2. Open the command palette (`F1` or `Ctrl+P`)
3. Use the `Extensions: Install from VSIX...` command and to select the VSIX package you just downloaded

### From Source

1. Clone this extension into the VSCode extensions folder (`%USERPROFILE%\\.vscode\\extensions\\` on Windows, `~/.vscode/extensions/`)
2. Just open a `*.in` file! if you don't see any syntax highlighting on what you think is a valid file, open the command palette (F1) and try "Change Language Mode".
3. Type in "spectre" to filter the languages and select `spectre-in` as your language of choice.

## Feature requests

Just open an issue! make sure to provide details, screenshots, anything that'll get your idea across! If it sounds concrete and I have time, I'll implement it!
